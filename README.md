# Advent of Code

My solutions to Advent of Code in Go.

## Example

These examples are mostly to remind myself.

```shell
# Solve specific puzzle.
go run 2015/01/main.go

# Run all tests.
go test ./...

# Run specific test.
go test 2015/01/main.go 2015/01/main_test.go

# Format all source files.
go fmt ./...
```
